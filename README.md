### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gammer0909, and here's some information about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [World War bass](https://github.com/Gammer0909/World-War-Bass)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Object Oriented Design, as well as basic graphics with BasicRender
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with C# and how to code effectively
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: GitHub (here)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned C# This summer, and I'm still learning

I love to learn, especially about programming. If you have a comment or anything that will help me, please feel free to contact me!

What I'm working on constantly changes, but I'll try to keep this page recent as to what I'm working on, and some of my code isn't public yet.
