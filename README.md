### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gammer0909, and here's some information about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Many things, including learning Math, C++, C#, minecraft modding, and more
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Object Oriented Design, and Graphics Programming (especially the math part!)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I LOVE math, if you have any tips or anything, let me know!

I love to learn, especially about programming. If you have a comment or anything that will help me, please feel free to contact me!

What I'm working on constantly changes, but I'll try to keep this page recent as to what I'm working on, and some of my code isn't public yet.

I'm currently working on a BIG project! The project is a WIP, you can look at it [here](https://github.com/Gammer0909/DungeonCrawler)
